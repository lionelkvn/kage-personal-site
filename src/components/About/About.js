            Hello there, I'm Kage, a Shih Tzu with a heart full of love and a name that means "shadow" in Japanese. I've been sharing my life with my human companion, Lionel, and I can't help but feel like his shadow, always by his side and ready to offer unconditional love and companionship. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            My days are filled with joy when Lionel is around. We share an unbreakable bond, and I can't imagine being apart from him for too long. Whether he's working, going for a walk, or just lounging at home, I'm right there beside him, offering my support and affection
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
           One thing that makes me particularly happy is food, especially chicken and chicken liver. You can see the excitement in my eyes and the wagging of my tail when I catch a whiff of that delicious aroma. Lionel knows just how to make me happy with a tasty treat, and I'm forever grateful for those moments. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I may be small in stature, but my love for Lionel is immeasurable. I believe that being his shadow is the most important job in the world, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. So, whether we're taking leisurely strolls in the park, cuddling up on the couch, or sharing a meal together, you can bet I'll be right there, living up to my name, Kage, and staying true to my role as Lionel's loyal and loving companion.
